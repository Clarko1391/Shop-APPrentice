# Shop APPrentice
Built to make my life easier while working as a hobbyist furniture-maker, I came up with this app to easily convert between metric and imperial measurements without having took look up conversion charts or grab a calculator. I also added a Reference Manual function to keep handy reference tables accessible and easy to use while in the middle of my workflow!

My plan is to add the option for users to upload their own reference tables to their versions of the app to increase the usefulness even further!
