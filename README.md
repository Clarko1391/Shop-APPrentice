# Shop APPrentice
Built to make my life easier while working as a hobbyist furniture-maker, I came up with this app to easily convert between metric and imperial measurements without having took look up conversion charts or grab a calculator. I also added a Reference Manual function to keep handy reference tables accessible and easy to use while in the middle of my workflow!

Deisgned in Figma and built from scratch in pure HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JS, this was my second major project on my path to becoming a full-stack developer.

This version of the app is still usable and is hosted on Github Pages here: https://clarko1391.github.io/Shop-APPrentice/
You can also clone the repo and use LiveServer in VSCode to run index.html and check out an offline version on your local machine.


I have since re-built the core functionality and added new features to this app in different technologies as a means to further develop my skills. Other versions of this app can be found in my other repos called "React-Shop-APPrentice" and "React-Redux-Shop-APPrentice"
